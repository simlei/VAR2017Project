Best viewing experience of the documentation is via our github page:
http://simlei.github.io/VAR2017Project

The HTML you see there is automatically generated from the markdown files in the root and ./doc folder.

README.md is the central file, containing the project descriptions, organization, links to discussion and further documentation.
